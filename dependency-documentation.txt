1. express

Purpose: Web framework for building the HTTP server and API routes.

Why needed:
Provides routing, middleware support, and request/response handling to build REST APIs efficiently.

2. cors

Purpose: Enables Cross-Origin Resource Sharing.

Why needed:
Allows frontend applications (running on different domains or ports) to access the backend API securely.

Without it, browsers block cross-origin requests.

3. helmet

Purpose: Adds security-related HTTP headers.

Why needed:
Protects the application against common web vulnerabilities such as:

Cross-site scripting (XSS)

Clickjacking

MIME sniffing

Protocol downgrade attacks

Improves security with minimal configuration.

4. morgan

Purpose: HTTP request logging middleware.

Why needed:
Logs incoming requests (method, URL, status code, response time).
Helps with debugging, monitoring, and identifying failed or slow requests.

5. dotenv

Purpose: Loads environment variables from a .env file.

Why needed:
Keeps sensitive data (e.g., database URLs, JWT secrets) out of source code.
Improves security and environment configuration management.

6. jsonwebtoken

Purpose: Creates and verifies JSON Web Tokens (JWTs).

Why needed:
Implements authentication and authorization by securely signing and validating tokens for users.

7. bcryptjs

Purpose: Password hashing library.

Why needed:
Ensures passwords are securely hashed before storing in the database.
Prevents storing plaintext passwords.

8. http-status-codes

Purpose: Provides named constants for HTTP status codes.

Why needed:
Improves readability and avoids using “magic numbers” like 200 or 404 directly in the code.

Example:

StatusCodes.OK
StatusCodes.BAD_REQUEST

9. mongodb

Purpose: Official MongoDB Node.js driver.

Why needed:
Enables communication with a MongoDB database for data storage and retrieval.

10. nodemon (Dev Dependency)

Purpose: Automatically restarts the server during development.

Why needed:
Improves development efficiency by reloading the server when code changes.

Not used in production.
